Scenario 03:
In this scenario the first hashes are created using the xxhash format. Different hash formats
might be required by systems used further down the workflow, so the second copy is verified
against the existing xxhash hashes, and additional MD5 hashes can be created and stored during
that process on demand.

Assume the source card /A002R2EC is copied to a travel drive /travel_01.

Seal the copy on the travel drive /travel_01 to create the original mhl generation.

$ ascmhl.py create -v /travel_01/A002R2EC -h xxh64
Creating new generation for folder at path: /travel_01/A002R2EC ...
  created original hash for     Clips/A002C006_141024_R2EC.mov  xxh64: 0ea03b369a463d9d

Created new generation ascmhl/0001_A002R2EC_2020-01-16_091500.mhl



Assume the travel drive arrives at a facility on the next day.
And the folder A002R2EC is copied there from the travel drive to a file server at /file_server.

Creating new generation for the folder A002R2EC again on the file server using MD5 hash format
this will verify all existing xxHashes, check for completeness,
and create a second generation with additional (new) MD5 hashes.

$ ascmhl.py create -v -h md5 /file_server/A002R2EC
Creating new generation for folder at path: /file_server/A002R2EC ...
