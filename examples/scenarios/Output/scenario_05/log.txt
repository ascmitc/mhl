Scenario 05:
Copying two camera mags to a `Reels` folder on a travel drive, and the entire `Reels` folder
folder to a server.

Assume the source card /A002R2EC is copied to a Reels folder on travel drive /travel_01.

Seal the copy of A002R2EC on the travel drive /travel_01 to create the original mhl generation.

$ ascmhl.py seal ['-v', '/travel_01/Reels/A002R2EC']

Assume a second card /A003R2EC is copied to the same Reels folder on travel drive /travel_01.

Seal the copy of A003R2EC on the travel drive /travel_01 to create the original mhl generation.

$ ascmhl.py seal ['-v', '/travel_01/Reels/A003R2EC']

Assume the travel drive arrives at a facility on the next day.
And the common Reels folder is copied from the travel drive to a file server at /file_server.

Afterwards an arbitrary file Summary.txt is added to the Reels folder.

Sealing the Reels folder on the file server.
This will verify all hashes, check for completeness and create two second generations
in the card sub folders A002R2EC and A003R2EC and an initial one for the Reels folder
with the original hash of the Summary.txt and references to the child histories
of the card sub folders.
