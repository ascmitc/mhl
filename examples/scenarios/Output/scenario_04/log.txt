Scenario 04:
Copying a folder to a travel drive and from there to a file server with a hash mismatch in
one file.

Assume the source card /A002R2EC is copied to a travel drive /travel_01.

Seal the copy on the travel drive /travel_01 to create the original mhl generation.

$ ascmhl.py create -v /travel_01/A002R2EC -h xxh64
Sealing folder at path: /travel_01/A002R2EC ...
  created original hash for     Clips/A002C006_141024_R2EC.mov  xxh64: 0ea03b369a463d9d
  created original hash for     Clips/A002C007_141024_R2EC.mov  xxh64: 7680e5f98f4a80fd
  calculated directory hash for Clips  xxh64: 6d43a82e7a5d40f6 (content), a27e08b77ae22c78 (structure)
  created original hash for     Sidecar.txt  xxh64: 3ab5a4166b9bde44
  calculated root hash  xxh64: 7e423206834bf81a (content), 574ab2d2afc981cd (structure)
Created new generation ascmhl/0001_A002R2EC_2020-01-16_091500.mhl



Assume the travel drive arrives at a facility on the next day.
And the folder A002R2EC is copied there from the travel drive to a file server at /file_server.

afterwards we simulate that during the copy the Sidecar.txt got corrupt (altered
by modifying the file content

Sealing the folder A002R2EC again on the file server.
This will verify all existing hashes and fail because Sidecar.txt was altered.
An error is shown and create a new generation that documents the failed verification

$ ascmhl.py create -v /file_server/A002R2EC -h xxh64
Sealing folder at path: /file_server/A002R2EC ...
