Scenario 01:
This is the most basic example. A camera card is copied to a travel drive and an ASC-MHL file is
created with hashes of all files on the card.

Assume the source card /A002R2EC is copied to a travel drive /travel_01.

Seal the copy on the travel drive /travel_01 to create the original mhl generation.

$ ascmhl.py seal ['-v', '/travel_01/A002R2EC']
seal folder at path: /travel_01/A002R2EC
created original hash for /travel_01/A002R2EC/Clips/A002C006_141024_R2EC.mov xxh64: 0ea03b369a463d9d
