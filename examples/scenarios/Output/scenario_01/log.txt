Scenario 01:
This is the most basic example. A camera card is copied to a travel drive and an ASC-MHL file is
created with hashes of all files on the card.

Assume the source card /A002R2EC is copied to a travel drive /travel_01.

Seal the copy on the travel drive /travel_01 to create the original mhl generation.

$ ascmhl.py create -v /travel_01/A002R2EC -h xxh64
Creating new generation for folder at path: /travel_01/A002R2EC ...
  created original hash for     Clips/A002C006_141024_R2EC.mov  xxh64: 0ea03b369a463d9d
  created original hash for     Clips/A002C007_141024_R2EC.mov  xxh64: 7680e5f98f4a80fd
  calculated directory hash for Clips  xxh64: 4c226b42e27d7af3 (content), 906faa843d591a9f (structure)
  created original hash for     Sidecar.txt  xxh64: 3ab5a4166b9bde44
  calculated root hash  xxh64: 8d02114c32e28cbe (content), f557f8ca8e5a88ef (structure)
Created new generation ascmhl/0001_A002R2EC_2020-01-16_091500.mhl
